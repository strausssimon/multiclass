Processmodel: CRISPDM

This project focuses on the automated assignment of subcategories to error tickets using deep learning. Manual categorization is inefficient and imposes a high workload on employees, with a risk of errors that affect data quality. Automating this process is particularly relevant for companies, as it can reduce manual effort, ensure compliance with service level agreements, and improve response times, leading to higher customer satisfaction. Automation also promises better service quality and optimized resource utilization.
